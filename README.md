# DevSecOps Pipeline Demo

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive DevSecOps implementation, showcasing modern security practices integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. It serves as a practical example of how to implement security-first development practices in a modern web application environment.

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Automated Security Testing
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**
  - SonarQube integration for code quality and security analysis
  - Semgrep for pattern-based vulnerability detection
  - Custom security rules enforcement
  
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**
  - OWASP ZAP integration for automated security scanning
  - API security testing with custom scripts
  
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**
  - Dependency scanning with Snyk
  - OWASP Dependency-Check integration
  - Container image scanning with Trivy

### 2. Security Controls
- Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning
- Container security with policies and best practices
- Runtime application security monitoring

### 3. Compliance & Governance
- Automated compliance checks
- Security policy as code
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Automated security documentation

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

This repository implements the following security best practices:

1. **Shift-Left Security**
   - Security testing integrated early in development
   - Developer security awareness training
   - Automated security checks in IDE

2. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Identity-based access control
   - Network segmentation
   - Least privilege principle

3. **Continuous Security Monitoring**
   - Real-time threat detection
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Security metrics dashboard
